The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the pseudo-element ::before is not displayed as intended when the parent element has a specific background color.

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #f00;
}

div::before {
  content: "Hello";
  color: #fff;
}
```

The expected behavior is that "Hello" should appear on top of the red background. However, in some browsers or configurations, it might not be visible.
