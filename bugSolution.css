Several approaches can address this issue. One solution is to ensure the parent element's `background-color` property doesn't interfere with the pseudo-element's visibility. In cases where the background color is crucial, consider adding a `z-index` property to the `::before` pseudo-element to ensure it's layered on top.  Another approach involves adjusting the parent element's position and adding a different positioning scheme to the `::before` element to enhance separation and visibility.

Here's an example of using z-index:

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #f00;
  position: relative; /* Important for z-index to work */
}

div::before {
  content: "Hello";
  color: #fff;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

Experiment with these solutions and adjust the CSS to fit your specific layout and design requirements.
